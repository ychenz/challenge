# Outreach Challenge

As a Business Development Representative and an early member of Ada Support’s sales team, you’ll be responsible for generating new qualified business opportunities.

An important activity you will be performing at Ada is creating cold email campaigns to send to prospects. The goal of these campaigns is to generate introductory phone calls with prospects.

Your challenge is to write an email campaign that is targeting new prospects from the perspective of a live chat provider (not Ada). Please submit the initial email you would send in the campaign, 3 companies you would approach including key employees you would reach out to, as well as a brief 3-4 bullet point strategy for how you would continue prospecting the account.

When you are finished, please send everything over in a google doc for feedback. 

Have fun, and please ask me questions during the process. Email [Dan](dan@ada.support) 🙂

## Email Campaign to Send

The live chat provider you will be creating the email campaign for is [Happy Fox](https://www.happyfox.com/).

## Challenge Requirements
- Initial outreach email
- List of 3 companies with key contacts
