Since Ada’s product enables teams to create an automated support experience, it’s crucial that your activity as a Customer Success Manager be exemplary, serving as the gold standard for both our customers and product team.

Your challenge is to create a bot for the education-technology company Top Hat that helps users who are struggling to enrol in a course, purchase a subscription, and reset their password. When you are finished, please send us the link to your bot for feedback.
