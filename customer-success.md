#Bot Building Challenge

As a Customer Success Manager, your job is guide our customers towards a successful experience with our company. Since Ada’s product enables teams to create an automated support experience, it’s crucial that your activity as a Customer Success Manager be exemplary, serving as the gold standard for both our customers and product team. 
 
An important activity you will be performing at Ada is building the initial bot experiences for our new customers based on their existing support articles. 
 
Your challenge is to create a bot for the education-technology company Top Hat that helps users who are struggling to enrol in a course, purchase a subscription, and reset their password. When you are finished, please send us the link to your bot for feedback. 
 
Have fun, and if you have questions, please feel free to contact [Mike](mailto:mike@ada.support)!
